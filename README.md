## ASTerisk's Brand New Cube Game REWORKED!

Basically GD, but remastered as a cool platformer game! (HEAVY WIP)

- Interface with Discord-ish colors and new sounds
- New levels (Story ones and infinity run)
- New game modes: Endless mode (OH MY GOD A BALDI'S BASICS REFERENCE!!!!), Story mode
- You now play as ASTerisk, the creator of this mod, instead of some kind of a random guy.
